[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zezulka/bulldog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zezulka/bulldog)

This is a copy of bulldog, the Java GPIO Library for BeagleBoneBlack, Raspberry Pi and CubieBoard.

Simply issue `mvn clean install` to install the library to the local Maven repository. For command-line installs it may prove to be useful to also specify `JAVA_HOME` environment variable (which is used in POM to add JNI includes for gcc).
